    <h2>Minesweeper is a video game in which players must open each numbered block without touching a mine in order to win. Players must click on any unrevealed square on the board to accomplish this. The number on a block represents the number of mines that surround it, and in order to win, players must clear all the squares and avoid all of the mines.</h2>
