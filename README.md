# Mine-Sweeper-Game
Logic puzzle video games like Minesweeper are typically played on personal computers. The game's board is made out of a grid of clickable squares with hidden "mines" dispersed all over it. With the aid of hints regarding the quantity of nearby mines in each area, the goal is to clear the board without detonating any mines.

## Deployment

The web game is deployed at <YOUR DEPLOYED GITHUB.IO URL GOES HERE>.


## Project Description

This Logic Puzzle video game is intended to be enjoyable and fairly demanding, with the difficulty increasing as the number of mines increases.The fact that this game is casual and best played with friends is what motivated me to make it.

## Game Logic

The player has the following options:
Flags: To identify the location of a bomb, press the flag button and clickk on a square.
Empty squares:when clicked it will eliminate areas without nearby bombs. 
Number squares:The number indicates the amount of bombs surrounding that square.
Bomb square:land on the bomb square, the game is over.
## Deliverables

Things to add later:
1.Sound/music
2.Timer
3.Easy/Medium/Hard button
4.Grid change size with other diffculty

### MVP Criteria

The MVP criteria met:
1.Player will win or lose
2.The game is winable
3.The game visually display a lose or win to the player.
4.HTML,JS,CSS was used in separate files
5.There is a readme.md file

### Post-MVP Plans

- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline was to add a sound board for the game.
- Another one was to add a timer and level difficulty.
- Something else I don't technically know how to do yet was to change the grid of the map into a shape to make the game more fun to look at like a happy face.
